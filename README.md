# A little insight into Jay Cee
Hi Everyone! My name is Jay Cee and I am not the author of any books yet, but I have written many manuals and system documentations. This README will give you a bit of information about me!

## My Career Passions
I really love working with technology. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help others build something amazing! Whether that's being a manager, or working with customers and relaying that information back to the developers, that is my sweet spot. I enjoy teaching and learning, so any role that enables me to flex my education muscles is the right role for me, that's why I ready enjoy writing.

## My Hobbies
One of my favourite things to do is go to Disneyland - even if i didn't go on any rides, just walking around the park and feeling the magic is enough for me :smile:
### Some more stuff

## My Favourite Books
I absolutely love the Harry Potter books, they are so engaging and rich. What is even better is the community that has formed around it. Lately, I have been listening to podcasts that do deep dives into the entire Harry Potter universe and it is so much fun.
